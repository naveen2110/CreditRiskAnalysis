# CreditRiskAnalysis
#In Credit risk analysis my main aim is to analyze data from the datasets to find people with high credit risk. In this project we analyze the efficacy of CART, Random forest and logistic regression models by analyzing the experimental data set and making predictions on the credit risk of a customer.
# The dataset was obtained from a Kaggle python notebook . The original dataset which the Kaggle notebook utilized was from UCI’s Machine Learning Repository and contains 1000 entries with 20 categorial/symbolic attributes prepared by Prof. Hofmann. In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit by a bank. Each person is classified as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes. The dataset has 1000 observations and 10 columns. Out of 10 columns, 8 variables are categorical, and the rest 2 numerical variables are age and credit amount. Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes like age, sex, job, housing etc. Risk is the target variable. So, our outcome is to predict whether the risk is Good or Bad. The variables are: 
●	Age: The age of customers varies from 19 to 75.
●	Sex: Male and Female
●	Job: 0 1 2 3 (can be considered as unskilled, skilled, highly skilled)
●	Housing: The type of housing customers are living in - own, free and rent.
●	Saving account: Whether their savings account is little, moderate, rich or quite rich
●	Credit account: Whether their credit account is little, moderate or rich.
●	Credit amount: Customer’s credit amount varies from $250 to $18424.
●	Duration: The duration to pay back the loan varies from 4 months to 72 months (6 years).
●	Risk: This represents whether our customer has a good credit or bad credit. (Good/Bad).
